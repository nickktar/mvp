Wealth & Abundance Hypnosis Script

Purpose: To cultivate an abundance mindset, remove mental blocks about money, and attract wealth positively into your life.1. Relaxation Induction:
Find a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down. Close your eyes and take a deep, slow breath in… and exhale fully, releasing any tension. Feel your body begin to relax. Now breathe in deeply once more, filling your lungs, and breathe out with a sigh, letting go of stress. Allow your breathing to fall into a calm, natural rhythm. With each exhale, imagine any worries or tension melting away. Starting at the top of your head and moving downward, gently relax each part of your body. Soften the muscles of your scalp and forehead. Release the tension around your eyes and jaw. Let your shoulders drop, your arms grow heavy, and your hands relax. Feel a wave of relaxation flowing down your chest, your abdomen, into your legs, and all the way to your feet. With every breath out, you drift deeper into relaxation, knowing you are safe and in control. (Pause here for a few moments, enjoying this relaxed state.)2. Visualization – Planting the Seeds of Prosperity:
In this deeply relaxed state, visualize yourself standing at the entrance of a tranquil garden. The air is warm and comfortable, and you feel completely at ease. As you step into this garden, you notice it’s filled with symbols of abundance that resonate with you. Perhaps you see golden coins or gems lightly scattered along the path, or ripe fruit hanging heavy on trees—whatever represents wealth and prosperity to you. As you walk slowly through this garden, imagine each step taking you closer to unlimited abundance. You might spot a shining treasure chest under a tree; it’s overflowing with everything that would make you feel financially secure and free. See yourself opening that chest and smiling with gratitude as you realize there is more than enough to fulfill your needs and desires. Feel the warm glow of gratitude and excitement in your heart as you accept this abundance. Take a moment to truly experience the emotions of financial freedom—peace, joy, confidence. Let those feelings wash over you. You might even picture a golden light surrounding you, representing the energy of abundance. This light gently soaks into your being, dissolving any old fears or doubts about money. Know that you deserve this abundance and that it is already present in your life in many forms.3. Affirmations for Abundance:
Remaining in this calm, visualized state, mentally repeat the following positive affirmations. You can say them silently in your mind or speak them softly out loud (pause briefly after each one to let it sink in):
I deserve and welcome financial abundance into my life.
Money flows to me easily and effortlessly.
I use money in positive ways that benefit me and others.
I am grateful for all the wealth and opportunities I receive.
With each day, I become more confident and successful.
As you affirm these beliefs, feel each statement to be true. Notice any warmth or tingling of positivity as your subconscious mind absorbs these new beliefs. If any old negative thoughts about money arise, simply let them float away like clouds, refocusing on the positive truths you just stated. Take a gentle breath in, breathing in confidence, and exhale any lingering doubt.4. Suggestion and Empowerment:
Now, imagine your future self a little while from today – perhaps weeks or months ahead – living a life of financial stability and abundance. See yourself feeling secure and happy, easily paying bills, saving money, or making wise investments. Perhaps you’re doing work you love and being well-rewarded for it, or enjoying extra income from a successful venture. Notice how naturally you handle money and how grateful and generous you are with your abundance. In this future scene, every time you make a financial decision, you feel calm and confident. Every opportunity you need just appears at the right time. You realize that wealth is not just about money – it’s also about freedom, security, and the ability to help others. Feel the pride in how far you’ve come. These positive habits and feelings are growing stronger within you. Your mind is now programmed for success – you will notice opportunities to increase your prosperity, and you will take them with optimism and wisdom. You’ll find that you naturally attract supportive people and ideas that lead to greater wealth. And as you prosper, you remain balanced, using your wealth to improve your life and the lives of those around you. This positive mindset will stay with you, empowering your actions long after this session.5. Return to Waking Consciousness:
It’s now time to bring your awareness back to the present moment, carrying with you all the positive feelings and insights you gained. I will count from 1 up to 5, and with each number you’ll become more alert and awake. By the count of 5, you will be fully awake, refreshed, and excited to move forward with a mindset of abundance.1… Feeling energy returning to your arms and legs as you become aware of your body.
2… Becoming more alert. Take a deep breath in, filling your lungs with energy.
3… Feeling your mind clear, secure in the knowledge that you are attracting wealth and success.
4… Almost fully awake now, wiggling your fingers and toes, feeling light, confident, and positive.
5… Open your eyes, fully awake, refreshed and enthusiastic. You feel great and ready to embrace the opportunities that come your way, knowing that abundance is all around you.(End of Wealth & Abundance Script. Take a moment to stretch and enjoy the positive state you’re in.)
