## Marczell's Journey

Born in Los Angeles in 1998, Marczell grew up in a successful and prosperous family in Southern California, until the crash and Great Recession of 2008.

Having seen firsthand the loss of his family's position almost overnight, the lesson Marczell took from the experience was to build a career in which he was always moving forward.

It's a lesson he applied at William Howard Taft High School when he became an all-star athlete and set his eyes on someday becoming a medical doctor.

As a hypnotist, his aim still is to help as many people as he can. He became interested in the mind's inner workings after a brief theatrical performance featuring a stage hypnotist.

Using just simple stage techniques, the hypnotist managed to turn one of Marczell's closest friends from a shy introvert into a much more outspoken and confident person.

That chance encounter would, it turned out, set the rest of Marczell's life on a path toward helping people learn more about themselves and to access hidden sources of strength they didn't know they had.
